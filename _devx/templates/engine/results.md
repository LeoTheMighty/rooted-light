<!-- Written by /devx outcome when measure_by comes due. Scores the PRD's
     numeric goals against reality. keep = mechanical; tune/restart/retire =
     recorded judgment. tune reopens via the revision cascade keyed to the
     missed expectations; restart links a v2 workstream with
     learns_from/superseded_by lineage.
     (tune's reopen is verification-scoped: evals_red clears and the stage
     rolls back to red so the missed expectations' RED artifacts re-run;
     revising the expectation/design/plan itself goes through devx revise.) -->

## Goal scores

| Goal | Target | Actual | Source | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G-1 | <target> | <measured> | <where the number came from> | <hit / miss / partial> |

## Reading

<what the numbers mean; what surprised us>

## Disposition

<why the frontmatter outcome; if tune: which E-ids reopen and what changes;
if restart: what the successor keeps and abandons; if retire: what gets
removed and when>
