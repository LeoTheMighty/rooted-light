## Goal

Run the native retro stage (`/devx retro` — the `## Stage: Retro` section of `.claude/commands/devx.md`) on epic-rooted-light-website; append findings to `LEARN.md § epic-rooted-light-website`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `/devx retro` stage run against shipped stories (rlw101, rlw102, rlw103, rlw104, rlw105, rlw106, rlw107).
- [ ] Findings appended to `LEARN.md § epic-rooted-light-website` (create section if absent).
- [ ] Each finding tagged `[confidence]` (low/med/high) + `[blast-radius]` (memory/skill/template/config/docs/code).
- [ ] Low-blast findings applied in retro PR.
- [ ] Higher-blast findings filed as MANUAL.md or new specs.
- [ ] Cross-epic patterns hitting ≥3 retros total promoted into `LEARN.md § Cross-epic patterns`.

## Technical notes

- Sunset per Phase 5 epic-retro-agent + epic-learn-agent.
- Emitted by `/devx-plan` Phase 5 (pln102) at planning time — mode=YOLO, shape=empty-dream, thoroughness=send-it (provenance; the retro itself runs under whatever mode is active at /devx claim time).
